        <h2>What is Integrative Psychotherapy?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="large">
        <p>
            Integrative therapy is a form of psychotherapy that combines different therapeutic tools and approaches to fit the needs of the individual client.
        </p>

        <p>
            Psychoanalysis was first developed by Sigmund Freud and, as more therapists began to practice, other theories were established. This led to an emergence of a number of different approaches alongside the more traditional methods of psychoanalysis.  Common therapies include: cognitive behavioural therapy, person-centered psychotherapy, psychodynamic psychotherapy, gestalt therapy, body psychotherapy, family systems therapy, transactional analysis and existential therapy, to name but a few.
        </p>

        <p>
            An integrative practitioner is theoretically grounded in several approaches, and combines these in their practice with clients. With skilful, confidential and ethical therapy, it is the therapeutic relationship between the therapist and client that is said to be at the heart of the process of transformation.
