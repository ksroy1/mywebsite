            As a UKCP trained integrative psychotherapist, I have worked within a bereavement service and a womenâ€™s centre, offering short-term and long-term counselling. Prior to this, I have had fifteen years of corporate experience working within the pharmaceutical industry in various training and management roles. My interests include international cuisine, world cinema and, more recently, software development - Kakali.
